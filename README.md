## ðŸ“„ Abstract

Spent coffee grounds, a by-product of coffee brewing, are known to contain chlorogenic acid, a compound that can be extracted using ethanol. Chlorogenic acid is of interest due to its antibacterial properties, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. One such bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, can cause wound infections and pneumonia and is resistant to certain antibiotics. This study aims to investigate and compare the antibacterial effectiveness of coffee ground extracts against P. aeruginosa, using ethanol at different concentrations as the extraction solvent. Previous findings suggest that the amount of organic compounds extracted from coffee grounds varies with ethanol concentration, but not in direct proportion. Therefore, this research focuses on how solvent concentration affects the extraction efficiency and antibacterial activity. Coffee grounds were extracted with ethanol at various concentrations at 60Â°C for one week. The extracts were then filtered, and ethanol was evaporated. The resulting substances were tested against P. aeruginosa using the agar diffusion method. Results showed that only 80% ethanol in the control group exhibited antibacterial activity. In contrast, all coffee ground extracts demonstrated higher inhibition, with effectiveness increasing alongside ethanol concentration. The chlorogenic acid control also inhibited bacterial growth more effectively than ethanol alone, but less effectively than coffee ground extracts, using ethanol concentrations of 40% or higher. These findings suggest that other compounds in coffee grounds may work synergistically with chlorogenic acid to enhance antibacterial activity, while ethanol alone may be less effective due to its volatility.
